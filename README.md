## Is it ethical to give players the ability to kill people in a video game? 

 

Many modern games include high levels of violent content, often against human characters. When developing a game, it is important to consider the psychological effects it may have on its audience. This is both an ethical matter and a professional one, since a video game that is overly controversial may face censorship, age regulations, banning or negative player responses. Common psychological health concerns include increased levels of aggression, desensitization to violence and addiction to violent games. 

This essay will examine the ethical implications of giving the player the ability to kill humans within the game by investigating the validity of these concerns and discussing the extent to which violent content and the choice to kill influences these, compared to other factors such as the competitive nature of games, frustration when playing poorly and external factors such as lack of sleep caused by excessive playing of video games. 

It will also be necessary to account for ethical subjectiveness, as some demographics may hold different moral standards which influence their response to killing in video games.
